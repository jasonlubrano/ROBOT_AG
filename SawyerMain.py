# The home->hover->target->hover->home model prevents any unpredictable movements of the Sawyer arm
# by breaking up each movement into smaller sections to limit the degrees of freedom accessed at any one time.
# Sawyer does *not* have a map of the planter layout, nor are we going to use CV to make one.
# This serves as a form of "manual" collision detection, because we are relying on inverse kinematics taking us to
# known waypoints, but do not have knowledge about obstacles that may lie in between.
# Feature of the model we have laid out:
# - All movements will start and end at home position
#    - No ambiguity in environmental variables when states are transitioned
#    - Will always allow for weed detection CV to have an unblocked view
# - Hover->target->hover always restricts final action to vertical movement ONLY
#    - Presence of lateral obstacles is hard to predict as positions of seeds/plants changes over time
#    - Makes gripping tasks as predictable as possible
# - All movement paths are palindormic, in the sense that they are played forwards then backwards
#    - Maintains predictability in all pathing scenarios
